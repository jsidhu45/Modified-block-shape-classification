Step to Follow:

Step 1. Download the file with the name MBSCT.py and save it in your system drive.
Step 2. Download and install the latest python version.
Step 3. After installing the python, download the essential python libraries NumPy, Pandas, Tkinter, canvas and matplotlib using pip command.
Step 3. Open the command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the MBSCT.py file.
Step 4. Type ‘Python MBSCT.py’ and press enter. A Block shape classification tool will open on the window screen. 
Step 5. Click on the browse data file button and select the excel file containing the data.  
Step 6. Click on the execute button, wait till the code computes. The execution time depends on how bigger the data set is. The code will  automatically save the resultant excel file containing block number, alpha, beta and volume information after execution in the current directory. 
Step 7. After the code is executed, click on different plot buttons to generate the required plots.
